## Anna Lin – Portfolio (Bootstrap) ##

This is a personal portfolio website built with Bootstrap 4.5, showcasing my background, projects, and contact information. It is a migration of my Week 1 HTML/CSS portfolio into a more scalable and responsive design using Bootstrap’s grid system and prebuilt components. In this version, I also integrated a small jQuery UI Accordion within the “About” section to demonstrate interactivity and organize additional content neatly.

## ✨ Features ##
- 🧭 Responsive Navigation Bar: Collapsible menu for smaller screens using Bootstrap’s Navbar component.
- 💳 Card-Based Layouts: Projects and content sections use Bootstrap Cards for consistent styling and structure.
- 🧱 Mobile-First Grid System: Layout adapts smoothly across all screen sizes using Bootstrap’s 12-column grid.
- 🎨 Utility Classes: Simplified styling for colors, spacing, alignment, and typography, keeping CSS minimal.
- ♿ Accessibility Enhancements: Semantic HTML tags, labeled form controls, skip link for keyboard users, and live region feedback for form submissions.
- 🎛️ jQuery UI Accordion (optional): Adds interactive expanding panels in the About section, demonstrating integration of third party scripts.
- 🔒 Modern Practices; Uses external stylesheets, compressed Bootstrap assets, and HTML5 structural elements for clarity and performance.
